# RMODIS
These R scripts were written by Yanni Zhan, CIESIN, Columbia University. The script was modified to download, mosaic, reproject and rescale /250m /MOD13Q1 - MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 16 day timeseries for the country of Nigeria. The year needs to be changed in both scripts. It is set to run 2014. 

The outputs for 2014 are located on the AfSIS FTP Site

Revised scripts that were tweaked by Mengqi Wang, Data Science, Columbia University and run faster will be added shortly.
