# RMODIS
ModisEVINDVI-copy.R script was written by Yanni Zhan, CIESIN, Columbia University. The script was modified to download, mosaic, reproject and rescale /250m /MOD13Q1 - MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 16 day timeseries for the country of Nigeria. The year needs to be changed in both scripts. It is set to run 2014. 

The outputs for 2014 are located on the AfSIS FTP Site

RModisRevised_NDVI&EVI.R and Modis_Quarterly.R are scripts created to update the quarterly MODIS 250m /MOD13Q1 datasets as an alternative to the original Bash scripts. 

The quarterly updates are located on AfSIS FTP Site
