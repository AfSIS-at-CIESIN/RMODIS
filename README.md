The script was modified to download, mosaic, reproject and rescale /250m /MOD13Q1 - MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 16 day timeseries for the country of Nigeria. The year needs to be changed in both scripts. It is set to run 2014. 

The outputs for 2014 are located on the AfSIS FTP Site
